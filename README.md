# Text Purity
 The problem domain addressed in this project revolves around natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, which holds significant importance in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI). Understanding the sentiment expressed in textual data is crucial for various applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and content moderation. By leveraging AI techniques, we aim to develop a model capable of automatically classifying text comments into different sentiment categories, thereby facilitating efficient analysis of large volumes of textual data.
